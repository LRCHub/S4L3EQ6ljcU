I swear there was lightning
coming from your eyes
Starting a fire in a hotel room
And yeah we were dancing,
dancing to Bruno
And I couldn't turn away
from you
Yeah I saw you smiling,
breaking the silence
Telling me just what you want
There in the moment,
I was reminded
I haven't felt this way
in while
Blinded by the sparks
We were driving around
in the dark
Finding reasons to stay
where we are
All of my life
I've been sleep-walk living
Running around the same bars
I've been in
It can be so lonely in this city
But it feels different
when you're with me
All of my life,
it's been heartbreak weather
Thinking to myself
it won't get better
It can be so lonely in this city
But it feels different
when you're with me
Yeah, it was magic,
you were a vision
Watching the way your body moves
Taking your clothes off,
you look in the mirror
Telling me just what you want,
and I
Was blinded by the sparks
I was holding you close
in the dark
Finding reasons to stay
where we are
All of my life I've been
sleep-walk living
Running around the same bars
I've been in
It can be so lonely in this city
But it feels different
when you're with me
All of my life,
it's been heartbreak weather
Thinking to myself
it won't get better
It can be so lonely in this city
But it feels different
when you're with me
You,
that's what I've been missing
Was tangled up and twisted
Now all the clouds been lifted
Lately, my heart's been so empty
You,
that's what I've been missing
Was tangled up and twisted
Now all the clouds been lifted
Lately, my heart's been so empty
But it feels different
when you're with me
It feels different
when you're with me
All of my life
it's been heartbreak weather
Thinking to myself
it won't get better
It can be so lonely in this city
But it feels different
when you're with me
It feels different
when you're with me
